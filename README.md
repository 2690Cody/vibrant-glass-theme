If you wanna download it, just click this link : [this is a link c:](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kayno0o/vibrant-glass-theme/main/glass_remote.theme.css) and press ctrl+s

Then, to apply it, go to your [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) settings (in Discord) and go to themes -> [open themes] -> move the theme into your theme folder
